### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea is to implement these sections into pages and having them be easy to navigate around.
- To make the week based workout plans to appear in a weekly calander format when the screen sizes are larger, so it makes it more appealing to the user and easier to follow.
- Have a gallary page with images of users transformations and experiences of using the workout plans.
- Make the sign up form more detailed so that it request more information by giving a questionare.

The sign up form has been tested and works perfectly. It will require the user to input in all fields and make sure the email is in correct format.

### Unfixed Bugs

There is only one bug that has been noticed and that is the body images in the workout section do not align properly when the workout plans are expanded as shown below. This is because of the way the images were posiioned in each div element meant that they could not be refered to when the checkbox was checked. However this is not the case when all the section are expanded out at the same time, as all the body images get hidden. Because of the layout of the HTML code it was very challenging to figure (in CSS) out how to get the images to hide while some of the sections where expanded. This would be an easy solve with JAVA script as it can do more complicated executions.
