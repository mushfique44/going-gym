- Another feature idea is to implement these sections into pages and having them be easy to navigate around.
- To make the week based workout plans to appear in a weekly calander format when the screen sizes are larger, so it makes it more appealing to the user and easier to follow.
- Have a gallary page with images of users transformations and experiences of using the workout plans.
- Make the sign up form more detailed so that it request more information by giving a questionare.

Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
